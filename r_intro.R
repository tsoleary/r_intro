# Day One ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Basic Math ----
3 + 3
(3 + 2)^4 - 1
(3 + 2)^(4 - 1)

# Assigning variables
x <- 1
y <- 1

x + y

# Also you can save characters as variables
x <- "meow"

# Naming variables ----
greet <- "hello"
name <- "Tom"

print(c(greet, name))

c(greet, name)

# Cases
snake_case <- "This is snake case"
camelCase <- "This is camel case"
chaoscase <- "I don't recommend this"

# Forbidden characters
# _var <- 1
# 1_var <- 1
F <- 1 # This is a bad idea
T <- 1 # Bad

# Data types -------------------------------------------------------------------
char <- "letters or anything -- 1 $ % !"
char

# Check the class with the class function
class(char)
# You can use the question mark to ask what a function does
?class

# Numeric variable
num <- 1
class(num)

# Logical
log <- FALSE
class(log)
?log

# Factors are sorta a specific type of character or numeric data type with
#   levels
fac <- as.factor("cats")
fac


# Objects can be of different length
# Vectors

vec <- c(1, 2, 4, 6, 10)

?c

# You can have characters, but it will make everything else into a character

# Let's sequence some stuff for fun
100000:1

?seq

# What if we wanted specific items from this vector?
 # Indexing
# Starts at 1
vec_5[1]

vec_5[990]

# This gets the first two elements from the vec_5 object
vec_5[c(1, 2)]

# These are equivalent
vec_5[c(1:10)]
vec_5[1:10]

# What is the length of vec_5
last_index <- length(vec_5)

# What is the last number in vec_5
vec_5[length(vec_5)]

vec_5[200001]

# What if we wanted the last 10 elements?
# Hard coding - BOOOO -- JK not really... but there are other ways
vec_5[199991:200001]

# Let's soft-code it
vec_5[(length(vec_5) - 10):length(vec_5)]
# When it gets complicated break it down!!

# But what if R already has a way to do that?????

# Create two vectors
